# Delivery Notes

You are not expected to complete the entire talk. Get through as much as you can. We do not require testing as a graduation requirement or technology to implement in their projects, however it is likely going to come up very early in their development career, hence our talk on the topic.

Mention the order of the two pieces of data in an assertion: `expect(response_from_application).to eq(known_good_data_likely_set_up_in_spec)`

This diagram shows the inside out approach to our tests.

There is one big feature test that treats the API like a black box, it makes a request and expects a response back like a curl request.

The smaller circles represent the unit tests that isolate a layer of the API and just tests that one aspect.

When we write the code that makes our last unit test pass, the feature test should pass as well.

Using the word should here is due to this Behavior Driven Development style.

Our workflow for writing the tests. They should always fail after we write them because we write the code after the test.

## Response status codes

Why does the `response` object in tests almost always have status code 200?
Stack Overflow knows.

> So, looking at the the in-code documentation for ActionController::TestCase::Behavior, under the Special Instance Variables section, we can see that ActionController::TestCase will automatically provide a @response instance variable (readable as just response in the test), which is "an ActionDispatch::TestResponse object, representing the response of the last HTTP response". So, that would seem to explain why there is a response able to be accessed without needing an explicit request made in a controller spec, but why is it's status 200?

>Well, ActionDispatch::TestResponse inherits from ActionDispatch::Response, which when initialized provides 200 as the default status. You can even test this out in your rails console:

So from within an it block response is a method that will return the value of the instance variable @response. That instance variable will contain whichever the last response was, and it's default status code is 200 before any requests are made.
